How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
diff pointed out the lines that had changed and presented them so I could see the two lines together

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
easily being able to track changes could help you find bugs more quickly

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
You run the risk of going too long before a commit, but you don't have to commit with every little change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is made for projects, Google Docs is meant for office documents

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log can show all the commits on a project and git diff can be used to see what changed between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
if something breaks, you can just revert back or see which line might have caused the issue, bot very easily

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
all of my future projects
